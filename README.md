# Advancing Automated ECG Interpretation

This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model capable of identifying 18 distinct cardiac abnormalities from a dataset comprising 43,100 12-lead ECG recordings. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model strives to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ECG interpretation, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed clinical decisions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Data Sources
The dataset was gathered from multiple institutions, including:
- Southeast University, China
- St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics
- Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
- Georgia University

The data includes ECG signals recorded from various heart leads, with each entry annotated with diagnostic codes corresponding to specific cardiac conditions.

## Key Findings
- The CNN model achieved the highest accuracy in diagnosing ECG abnormalities, highlighting its potential for practical use.
- Overfitting was observed in some models, particularly with the CNN, suggesting the need for better regularization.
